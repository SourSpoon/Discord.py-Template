## Discord.Py Template

This is a simple template that has the basics that you would either need or want in pretty much all discord bots written in discord.py. **IT DOES EXPECT YOU TO KNOW PYTHON!**

Note this uses the Rewrite branch of discord.py. which can be found [here,](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite) and his licence is [here.](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/blob/rewrite/LICENSE)

I have intentionally not included most logic, and instead just laid the ground work for you to impliment your own code. It also requires python 3.6+ however with some simple modification it can be used with python 3.5.

So feel free to fork it and create your own bot!
